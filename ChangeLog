FILE: pm8a-demod-decode6q.c
	Transfered changes to implement Frequency Change
  Compensation from development version of the program to this file.
  Those changes are summarized below:
	Increased search range for trailer to -250 Hz - +250 Hz.
	Fixed calculation of frequency offset of trailer (exidxW[]).
	Changed to new model of linear drift for local oscillator.
	Limited lead_x[0].sidx to be >= 0.
	Fixed initialization condition for pv[lo].
	Sorted some erased symbols, based on distance from a legal value.
	Added saving of distances for symbols needing 3 subcarrier values
  changed in order to match a legal value.
	Changed threshold for framing sequence cross-correlation
  good/bad discrimination.
	Added limits on standard deviation of demodulated values for
  acceptance of a good framing sequence.

FILE: pm8a-demod-decode6q.c
	Removed: some commented out code and 'fnok'.

	Changed logic on use of	default file name for decoded file.  Now the
  default file name is used if the first block fails to decode properly.

2003 May  14  Barry Sanderson

FILE: bin2sym307pm8a.c
	Changed so that input file name can now be a path name, with
  just the basename being encoded in the output of this program; any
  leading directory names are removed from what is to be sent as the
  file name.  If the compiler preprocessor symbol "PATH_DELIM_BACK"
  is defined, then the '\' character will be used  as the path separator
  character; else, if the preprocessor symbol "PATH_DELIM_COLON" is
  defined, then the ':' character will be used as the path separator
  character; otherwise, the '/' character will be used as the path
  separator character.
  	Added 2003 to copyright statement.

FILE: make-Wyman1x-wav
  	Added code to allow input path name for file to be encoded,
  thus file no longer needs to be in current directory.
  	Added 2003 to copyright statement.

**********************************************************************
2003 Jan. 02  Barry Sanderson

FILE: make-Wyman1x-wav
  	Changed to permit input file names containing space characters.
  This involved changing from tclsh to tcl in order to use the "system"
  command provided by Extended Tcl.
  	Removed commented out code that is no longer used to remove
  files.

  for the case of only two framing sequences (only one code block).
	Removed "Hamming window and" from message identifying program used.

FILE: pm8a-demod-decode6q.c
	Changed value of gap_offi from 43 to 8.  43 was left over from the
  (pm7) case where the leader and trailer were unmodulated.
	Relaxed the criteria for a subcarrier to be considered "good" in
  lm_match3, and relaxed the criteria for returning a value indicating
  success.
	Relaxed the criteria for calculating the least squares best fit of the
  "good" subcarriers to their corresponding ideal values, when searching for
  the leader and trailer.
	Fixed the array of "good" subcarrier values passed to "cbfitx" so
  that is is correct when not all of the subcarriers are "good".

  	Added checking of value returned from fwrite().  Now, an error
  message is generated if the wrong number of bytes was actually written.

FILE: make-Wyman1x-wav
  	Commented out the deletion of files: lo\[0-7\].flt pm\[0-7\].flt],
  as this is now done by the modulator program (mod_pm8a).

  	Temporary files are now deleted from within this program, in order to
  reduce the amount of temporary disk space used.
  	Added checking of value returned from fwrite().  Now, an error
  message is generated if the wrong number of bytes was actually written.

  	Added information used to estimate amount of temporary disk space
  used by transmit side programs.
  	Added information used to estimate amount of memory and swap space
  used by receive side program.

  	Corrected an error in one of the example commands.
  	Removed the reference to manually deleting temporary files, which
