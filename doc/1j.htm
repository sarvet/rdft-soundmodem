  <h1>Tx Operational Considerations</h1>

  <p>The basic principal to follow is to keep your equipment within its
  linear range of operation.</p>

  <p>I found that the linear range of operation of my sound card was
  essentially the middle half of its dynamic range.  When signals with sample
  values in the upper quarter, or lowest quarter of my sound card's dynamic
  range were generated by my sound card, they showed evidence of non-linear
  operation.  Since then, I have scaled signals to only use the middle half of
  my sound card's dynamic range.</p>

  <p>If the line input, or microphone input, to your sound card is connected
  to an audio source, then that audio will be present in the audio output of
  your sound card, unless those unwanted sources are muted while your sound
  card is supplying audio input to your transmitter.</p>

  <p>The audio level going into the radio has been the most difficult setting
  to make on the transmit side.  A two tone test signal was developed to aid
  this process.  It is the file named "2tone1180-1520v4-12sec.wav".

  <h2>2 Tone Signal</h2>
  <p>The two tone test signal consists of the sum of an 1180 Hz sinusoid and
  a 1520 Hz sinusoid.  Note that these frequencies straddle the 1200 Hz and
  1500 Hz lines on the MMSSTV spectrum display.  During the first 2 seconds
  of the two tone signal, a constant amplitude is maintained.  At the 2 second
  point in the signal, the amplitude steps down, such that the power drops by
  3 db.  This level is maintained until the 4 second point in the signal is
  reached.  At the 4 second point, the amplitude drops again, so that the
  power drops by another 3 db.  This level is maintained until the 6 second
  point in the signal.  At the 6 second point, the amplitude steps back to
  its original level, resulting in a 6 db increase in power.  The last 6
  seconds of the two tone signal are a repetition of the first 6 seconds.</p>

  <p>For the case of a SSB transmitter, if you can monitor the output power
  of your transmissions, then you can set the level properly by adjusting it
  until you see the -3db, -3db, +6db, -3db, -3db sequence in your output
  power while transmitting the two tone test signal.  This is the most
  reliable way to set the level for a SSB transmitter.</p>

  <p>If you can't monitor your output power, then a receiver can be used to
  monitor your transmissions.  However, if the receiver is not adjusted
  properly, it can be the source of non-linearity, rather than the
  transmitter.</p>

  <a name="2t2"></a>
  <p>When the person monitoring your transmission of the two tone
  signal can hear the -3db, -3db, +6db, -3db, -3db pattern, then you know that
  both the transmitter and receiver are adjusted properly.  An alternative to
  listening to the audio of the two tone signal is to monitor it with a
  spectrum display program.  The MMSSTV program has been used for this
  purpose.  When the levels are set up properly on both the transmitter and
  the receiver, there will be only two frequencies present in the spectrum
  display of the received two tone signal.  When the level is too large, at
  either the transmitter, or the receiver, or both, then the spectrum display
  will show energy present at more than just two frequencies.  The spurious
  energy is generated by non-linear operation.</p>

  <p>Note that the non-linearity may be in the sound card at the receiver. 
  It is possible for the two tone signal coming out of the receiver to
  contain energy at only two frequencies, but the spectrum display shows
  energy at more than two frequencies.  The cure for this situation is to
  reduce the level going into the sound card.  Unfortunately, evidence of
  non-linear operation on a spectrum display does not tell you where, in the
  chain of equipment the non-linearity is happening.  It could be in:
<ul>
<li> the sound card at the transmitter, or
<li> the transmitter, or
<li> the receiver, or
<li> the sound card at the receiver, or
<li> any combination of the above.
</ul>
</p>
  <p>Once you get everything into the linear
  range of operation, you can adjust one thing at a time to determine   
  what it takes to begin non-linear operation of the various pieces of
  equipment in the chain.</p>

  <p>One series of tests demonstrated that one transmitter operating in
  FM mode generated many more spurious emissions when over driven, than it did
  when operating in SSB mode and was over driven.  Thus, you need to be much
  more careful in setting the audio level going into the radio when operating
  in FM mode than you do when operating in SSB mode.</p>

  <h2>Spectrum of leader when both ends are setup properly</h2>

  <p>Below is the spectrum of part of the leader section of a
  transmission from Australia to the United States.  The energy of this signal
  should be concentrated at 12 different frequencies, with no significant
  energy being present at any other frequencies.  This is the case for the
  spectrum below, which shows there was no significant non-linear operation of any equipment
  in the chain.</p>
<img src="1j11.gif">

  <p>The spectrum above shows that the frequency response of this channel was
  not very flat, during the leader portion of the signal.  The two highest
  frequency subcarriers (nominally at 1955 Hz and 2185 Hz) are unmodulated
  during the leader, and start out at the same amplitude.  The spectrum above
  shows that they differ in amplitude by about 10 db, with the one at 1955 Hz
  being weaker, at this receiving location.</p>
  
  <h2>Spectrum of leader with non-linear operation</h2>

  <p>Below is the spectrum of part of the leader section of the same
  transmission from Australia to the United States.  The receiver was
  different for the spectrum below and the spectrum above.  The transmitter was
  the same for these two cases.  Looking at the plot below, you can see three
  spikes above 2200 Hz generated by
  non-linear operation by equipment at this receiving location.<p>
<img src="1j12.gif">

  <p>The spectrum just above shows that the frequency response of this channel was
  also not very flat, during the leader portion of the signal.  The nominally
  1955 Hz and 2185 Hz subcarriers are reversed in relative strength at this
  receiving location, with respect to their relative strength at the first
  receiving location.  These two receiving locations are about 80 air miles
  apart, and about 9500 air miles from the transmitter (in Australia).</p>

  <p>Since the subcarriers are 230 Hz apart, some spurious energy may show up
  at integer multiples of 230 Hz, due to intermodulation distortion, when
  there is non-linear operation.  Also, non-linear operation can create
  harmonics of frequencies actually present.  Harmonics of the lower
  frequencies may fall in the desired passband of the signal.  Harmonics of
  the higher frequencies may be aliased, due to the sampling process, so that
  their aliases fall in the desired passband of the signal.</p>

  <p>Even though equipment at the second receiving location was operated in the
  non-linear mode, it was not severe enough to prevent all of the errors from
  being corrected.</p>
