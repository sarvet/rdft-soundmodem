  <h1>Rx Operational Considerations</h1>

  <p>Before recording, set your sound card to sample at 11,025 Hz and
  16 bits per sample.</p>

  <p>If you forget to set your sound card to 11,025 Hz and 16 bits, convert
  your recorded files to these values before trying to decode them with
  "Wyman1x-demod-decode".  The "Wyman1x-demod-decode" program depends on the
  sampled data having these parameters, but DOES NOT CHECK them.  If the
  sampling parameters are not 11,025 Hz and 16 bits per sample,
  "Wyman1x-demod-decode" will fail, and not tell you why it failed.</p>

  <p>The basic principal to follow is to keep your equipment within its
  linear range of operation.</p>

  <p>If you operate with the RF gain control at maximum and let the AGC limit
  the signal level, you will get poorer results than if you operate with the
  RF gain control backed off to the point where you have the best signal to
  noise ratio.  Having a loud signal is counterproductive, when the loudness
  comes at the expense of non-linear operation.</p>

  <p>A two tone signal has been developed to aid in setting the audio
  level.  This two tone signal is also useful in setting the level going into
  the transmitter.  It is the file named "2tone1180-1520v4-12sec.wav".</p>

  <p>The two tone test signal consists of the sum of an 1180 Hz sinusoid and
  a 1520 Hz sinusoid.  Note that these frequencies straddle the 1200 Hz and
  1500 Hz lines on the MMSSTV spectrum display.  During the first 2 seconds
  of the two tone signal a constant amplitude is maintained.  At the 2 second
  point in the signal, the amplitude steps down, such that the power drops by
  3 db.  This level is maintained until the 4 second point in the signal is
  reached.  At the 4 second point, the amplitude drops again, so that the
  power drops by another 3 db.  This level is maintained until the 6 second
  point in the signal.  At the 6 second point, the amplitude steps back to
  its original level, resulting in a 6 db increase in power.  The last 6
  seconds of the two tone signal are a repetition of the first 6 seconds.</p>

  <p>If you can receive the transmission of the two tone test signal, from
  someone you believe is operating within the linear range, then you can
  adjust the RF gain, AGC, and audio level on the receiver, so that you can
  hear the -3db, -3db, +6db, -3db, -3db pattern of the two tone signal. 
  Alternatively, if you have a program that displays the spectrum of an audio
  signal going into your sound card, you can adjust things so that
  substantially all of the energy in the two tone signal is at only the two
  frequencies.  If you see significant energy at more than two frequencies,
  when monitoring the two tone signal, then something is operating in the
  non-linear range.</p>

  <p>I found that the linear range of operation of my sound card was
  essentially the middle half of its dynamic range.  When signals with sample
  values in the upper quarter, or lowest quarter of my sound card's dynamic
  range were digitized by my sound card, they showed evidence of non-linear
  operation.  Since then, I have tried to keep signals I record in the middle
  quarter to middle half of my sound card's dynamic range.</p>

  <p>When recording, make sure that only the desired input to your sound card
  is providing the audio signal being recorded.</p>

  <h2>Spectra of leader, one transmission, three different recordings</h2>

  <a name="ls"></a>
  <p>The next three plots show the spectrum of the leader
  section of the same transmission, as received by three different
  people.  All three recordings of this transmission were decoded
  successfully.</p>

  <p>Since the first plot shows significant energy at only 12 frequencies, we
  know that the transmitter and this receiver were both operating in the
  linear range.</p>
<img src="1j11.gif">
  <p>This second plot shows significant energy at more than 12 frequencies,
  thus, the receiver and/or sound card were being operated in the non-linear
  range.</p>

  <p>In the plot below, note that the two largest
  spikes above 2200 Hz are spaced at 230 Hz intervals, and thus are
  not due to random noise, but to non-linear operation</p>
<img src="1j12.gif">
  <p>The spectrum below shows no significant energy at 230 Hz, nor above 2200
  Hz.  Thus, this receiver was operated within its linear range.</p>
<img src="1k13.gif">
  <p>Below is a list of the errors that were corrected in each of the three
  recordings, whose leader spectra are shown above.</p>

  <p>An <a href="ec-fmt.html">explanation of the error list format</a> is
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The middle case, in which the receiver was operated in its non-linear
  range, had the lowest average number of error free symbols, 45.875 compared 
  to 54.375 for the first case and to 53.5 for the third case.

  <h2>Overall envelop of recorded signals</h2>

  <p>Following are plots showing the overall envelope of each of the three
  recordings, whose <a href="#ls">leader spectra</a> are shown above.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the first envelope plot, there is evidence of
  amplitude changes, due to a 3 second version of the <a href="1j.htm#2t1">two tone
  signal</a> transmitted just before the chirp signal and the phase modulated
  signal.</p>
<img src="1k15.gif">
  <p>The plot below shows that the amplitude variations from a 3 second version of
  the <a href="1j.htm#2t1">two tone signal</a> near the beginning of this
  recording were compressed so that all 3 levels came out the same. 
  Non-linear operation removed the amplitude variation that was transmitted
  during the first three seconds of the signal.</p>

  <p>This is the loudest of the three recordings of the same transmission,
  and it had the smallest average number of error free symbols.  Loudness, at the
  expense of linearity is counterproductive.</p>
<img src="1k16.gif">
  <p>Below is the plot showing the envelope of the third recording of this
  same transmission.  This plot starts after the 3 second version of the 
  two tone signal. It is the least loud, of the three recordings, and had
  about the same average number of error free symbols as the first recording
  above.</p>
<!--
  <p>Keeping everything within its linear range of operation yielded the best
  results for this transmission.</p>
