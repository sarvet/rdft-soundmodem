  <h1>Error Correction Table Format</h1>
  <a name="te"></a>
  <p>The table headings are:</p>
  <pre>
Block inner  |      outer code      | outer   |       inner code
  #   code   |       erasures       | code    |         changes
      changes|1st   2nd   3rd   4th | changes |    0   1   2   3   4
----  ------ |---   ---   ---   --- |   ---   |  --- --- --- --- ---
  </pre>
  <p>Below is a list of each of the above column headings,
  from left to right, and an
  explanation of what is meant by each column heading.</p>

  <ul>

    <li>"Block #"
  <p>This is an index, starting with 0, used to internally number the
  outer code blocks.</p>

    <li>"inner code changes"
  <p>This is a total of how many of the sub-carriers had their phase 
  changed by the inner decoder, in its attempt to correct as many errors
  as it could.</p>

   <li>"outer code erasures"
  <p>An "erasure" means that an error has probably been detected, but not
   corrected.  The sub-headings "1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th" show how four
  different categories of erasures, detected by the inner decoder, are to be
  used by the outer decoder.</p>

  <p> All those in the "1st" column are to be used 1st, followed by those in
  the "2nd" column, followed by those in the "3rd" column, followed by those
  in the "4th" column.  The erasures in the "1st" column result from the
  received combination of phases being too far away from all code words, even
  when 4 of the 8 sub-carriers are ignored.  The erasures in the 4th column
  are close enough to the same code word when both 3 and 4, of the 8
  sub-carriers, are ignored.</p>

  <li>"outer code changes"
  <p>This is a count of the number of symbols corrected by the outer decoder.
  A negative number means that the outer decoder recognized that it could NOT
  decode the block correctly.</p>

  <li>"inner code changes"
  <p>The five sub-headings, "0, 1, 2, 3, and 4" indicate how many of the 8
  sub-carriers were changed by the inner decoder.  The numbers in the table
  are how many of the symbols (in each block) had the respective number of
  sub-carriers changed by the inner decoder.</p>
  <p>Thus, the sub-heading "0" is
  for the case of error free symbols (0 of the 8 sub-carriers were changed
  by the inner decoder.)</p>

  <li>
  <p>The last column has no heading.  The possible symbols in this column are:
  <ul>
    <li>+
    <p>which means all errors were corrected</p>
    <li>-
    <p>which means not all errors were corrected<p>
    <li>*
    <p>which means an illegal symbol was present in the decoded output</p>
  </ul>
  <p>All "+" symbols in the last column means all errors were successfully
  corrected.  Anything else, means not all errors were corrected.</p>
  </ul>
