<li>Operational Considerations</p>

<p>The primary concern here is setting an acceptable audio level.  This
needs to be done once, prior to using the programs to transfer files.
Once you determine acceptable levels for your equipment, you can just
return to the corresponding settings, without repeating the procedures
described in the links just below.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

  <p>The purpose of this software is to enable binary data files to be
  transferred reliably, via a relatively poor audio channel.  An example of
  such a channel is that used between Australia and the United States in
  20 meter Single Side Band amateur radio transmissions.</p>

  <p>Software for both the transmit side operations and the receive side
  operations is provided.  The transmit side software requires the name of a
  file to be transferred and a choice of one of four levels of redundancy to
  be supplied to it.  The result of the transmit side software is a wav file
  that represents the contents of the file to be transfered, at the chosen
  level of redundancy.  Playing this wav file generates the audio signal that
  is to be transmitted to those who wish to have a copy of the file being
  transfered.</p>

  <p>The receive side software requires the name of a wav file as its input. 
  This wav file should be one recorded from a transmission of a wav file
  produced by the transmit side software.  The receive side software
  demodulates and decodes the information.  If
  all the errors are corrected, then the receive side software will have
  stored a copy of the original file on the hard disk of the computer on
  which it ran (i.e. the file will have been successfully transfered).</p>

  <p>Beginning with version 1.3.0, compensation for frequency changes that
  occur during a reception is applied by the Wyman1x-demod-decode program. 
  In some cases this compensation is detrimental to successful decoding.  For
  63 receptions of transmissions from Australia to the United States in the
  Spring of 2001, the net effect of applying the frequency change
  compensation was beneficial, that is, more files were successfully decoded
  with the frequency change compensation than without it.</p>

  <p>Beginning with version 1.2.0, if all the errors are corrected in some
  code blocks, but not in all code blocks, the completely corrected code
  blocks are written to separate files.  Three digits are appended to the
  file name of the entire file being transferred to make the file names used
  to store the individual code blocks.  Thus, completely corrected code
  blocks from multiple receptions <a href="#cmb">may be combined</a>
  into a completely corrected
  file as long as each code block was completely corrected in at least one
  transmission.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<ol>
<li>set desired value of "dbgl"
<p>There is one compile time parameter to set. It is "dbgl" in the file
  "pm8a-demod-decode6q.c".  The setting of this parameter controls how
  much  information is written to stdout by the "Wyman1x-demod-decode"
  program.</p>
<p>The relevant line to edit, and the following comment, from
  "pm8a-demod-decode6q.c" are reproduced below.</p>
<pre>
#define	dbgl	30
/* dbgl value controls what information is printed to stdout, and stderr

 (dbgl > 0)  =>  final tuning, final cppblk, mode weights, and error counts
		 written
 (dbgl > 10)  =>  leader & trailer information and initial framing sequence
		 search information written
 (dbgl > 20)  =>  final framing sequence search information written
 (dbgl > 30)  =>  positions for all framing sequences written, and
		   adjustments (at framing sequence times) to compensate
		   for changes in frequency written
 (dbgl > 35) => symbol position adjustment information, based on
		 amplitude, written to stderr
 (dbgl > 40)  =>  gnuplot style files containing demodulation results
		 for each subcarrier written; 40 < dbgl < 50 dumps
		 filtered, normalized angle differences; dbgl >= 50
		 dumps average amplitudes
 (dbgl > 50)  =>  symbol numbers for both codes for each block written
*/
</pre>
<p>An <a href="pm8a-out-example.html">example</a> for the default
  case of dbgl=30 has been augmented with an explanation for some of the quantities
  printed out by the program.</p>
<p>For the case of dbgl > 40, the demodulated results file names are of the
  form "loxdif23n.gnu", where "x" is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, for the
  respective subcarriers.  These same names are used, no matter what the
  input file name is.  Thus, if you want to save a particular case, you need
  rename the files to some other name.</p>

<li>execute make
<p>Executing "make" in the directory containing the source files will
  compile and link all of the necessary programs.  Four executable programs
  result from this process.  They are named:
  <ul>
  <li>bin2sym307pm8a
  <li>mod-pm8a
  <li>flt-clip-scale-wav
  <li>Wyman1x-demod-decode
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The warnings produced by gcc using the supplied Makefile warn of 22
  variables in "pm8a-demod-decode6q.c" and 16 variables in "decode2.c" that
  "might be used uninitialized".  The <a href="gcc-stderr.html">stderr from
gcc</a> listing these warnings is included for reference.  None of these 38
variables is used uninitialized.</p>

<li>move executables to desired location
<p>Move the four executable programs just made, and the supplied executable
tcl script to a directory listed in your PATH environmental variable.</p>

<li>move ancillary data files
<p>Move the three supplied ancillary data files to a location of your choice. 
These three files can be shared between multiple users.  The three files are
named: "2tone1180-1520v4-3sec.flt", "l3c.flt" and "t3c.flt".</p>

<li>edit "make-Wyman1x-wav"
<p>"make-Wyman1x-wav" is a supplied tcl script.  In this script, the default location for the
  three ancillary data files is the current directory.  If you put the three
  ancillary data files somewhere other than the directory that is current,
  when you execute "make-Wyman1x-wav", then you need to edit "make-Wyman1x-wav" to
  set the locations of the three ancillary data files.  A commented out
  example in "make-Wyman1x-wav" is for the case of the three ancillary data files
  being in "/usr/local/share/".</p>

<h1>Program Usage</h1>
<a name="warn"></a>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>

  <p>The behavior of this software reflects the
  research environment in which it was developed.  In some respects it
  behaves differently than you would likely expect.  These
  differences in behavior are listed below.<p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multiple instances of the same program, run by the same user in the same
current directory, WILL NOT WORK.  This is due to the use of fixed names for
some temporary files.</p>

<li><p>Existing files with the same name are OVERWRITTEN WITHOUT WARNING.</p>

<li><p>"Wyman1x-demod-decode" only works with 16 bit samples recorded at a sample
rate near 11,025 Hz., but DOES NOT CHECK this in the ".wav" file header.</p>
</ul>

<a name="txw"></a>
  <h3>Transmit Side Disk Space Usage</h3>

  <p>The "mod-pm8a" program uses a significant amount of disk space for
  temporary storage.  The amount depends on the size of the file being
  transfered and the amount of redundancy used.  The table below lists a
  factor which can be multiplied by the size of the file being transfered to
  yield an estimate of the peak amount of disk space that will be needed.</p>

  <p><pre>
     amount of redundancy    factor for est. of disk space
     --------------------    -----------------------------
            10 %                     4600
            20 %                     5200
            40 %		     6800
            70 %                    13000
  </pre></p>

  <p>The above table is for files about 2000 bytes in length.  The factor
  decreases slightly with increasing file size.  An example of the use of the
  above table is: for a file size of 3000 bytes and 20 % redundancy, the
  estimated amount of temporary disk storage needed is 3000 * 5200 bytes. 
  This is 15,600,000 bytes.</p>


<a name="txb"></a>
<h2>Transmit Side: Generation of wav File</h2>
<p>If you have "tcl" installed then you can use the supplied
  "make-Wyman1x-wav" script to run the 3 programs in sequence to generate a
  ".wav" file (to be played by a sound card) corresponding to a source file
  (that is to be transferred) and the chosen level of redundancy in the
  outer code.</p>
<p>The "make-Wyman1x-wav" script provides you the choice of having a 3 
  second version of the 2 tone test signal at the beginning of the wav file,
  or not having the 3 second version of the 2 tone test signal at all.
  If audio levels are to high, the 2 tone test signal can be used to
  <a href="1j.htm">detect this improper</a> operating condition.
  Another reason for
  including the 2 tone test signal is to provide the person at the
  receiving end time enough to "push the record button".  The
  default is to include the 2 tone test signal.  This provides 3 seconds of
  sound that is not
  used by the "Wyman1x-demod-decode" program.</p>
<p>Before running the "make-Wyman1x-wav" script, you can set whether, or not,
  you want to include the 2 tone test signal.  The instructions for doing
  this are in the "make-Wyman1x-wav" file.</p>
<p>The "l3c.flt" and "t3c.flt" signals are placed in front of, and after, the
  phase modulated signal.  The "l3c.flt" signal is used to start the
  automatic recording of a wav file by the DIGTRX program.  The "t3c.flt"
  signal is used to stop the automatic recording, and begin demodulation and
  decoding of the recorded wav file by the DIGTRX program.  These two signals
  were chosen so that they could be used for this automatic reception mode
  of operation, and so they could also be used to replace the current
  leader and trailer signals.</p>
<p>If you don't have "tcl" installed, then you can follow the
  <a href="man-tx.html">manual procedure</a> for running the 3 Tx side
  programs in sequence, or <a href="http://tcl.activestate.com/">download</a>
  and install the tcl software.</p>

<h3>Using make-Wyman1x-wav</h3>
<p>Two parameters are required by "make-Wyman1x-wav".  First is the name of the
  file to be transferred.  Second is one of: 1, 2, 3, or 4.  The second
  parameter selects the amount of redundancy to be used in the outer code,
  according to the following table.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>1 => 10% redundancy
<li>2 => 20% redundancy
<li>3 => 40% redundancy
<li>4 => 70% redundancy
</ul></p>

<p>For example, the following command line:
<pre>

make-Wyman1x-wav  file.xyz 3

</pre>
produces a file named "file.xyz.W1b3.wav".  The audio produced by playing this
  file represents "file.xyz", with 40% of the outer code symbols being
  redundant.</p>

<a name="sam"></a>
  <h3>Sampling Parameters</h3>

  <p>The short coming I expect to cause the most problems is the failure to
  check the sample rate and number of bits per sample in the .wav file header
  that is input to the "Wyman1x-demod-decode program".  None of the ".wav" recording
  programs I am aware of default to the 11,025 Hz, 16-bits per sample
  required by my program.  Even I didn't always remember to select the
  correct recording mode, before making recordings.</p>

  <p>The good news is that other sample rates and bit depths can be converted to
  11,025 Hz and 16 bits, and that recordings made at 22,050 Hz with only 8
  bits per sample have decoded just as well as those made at 11,025 Hz and 16
  bits per sample.  The bad news is that my program will fail, without
  telling you why, if it is given a ".wav" file that is not 11,025 Hz with 16
  bits per sample.</p>

<a name="rxw"></a>
  <h3>Receive Side Memory Usage</h3>

  <p>The "Wyman1x-demod-decode" program dynamically allocates a significant
  amount of memory.  To estimate how much extra memory will be needed, you can
  multiply the size of the "wav" file being operated on by 35.  This factor
  increases with increasing file size.  For a "wav" file of 500,000 bytes the
  factor is about 30.  For a "wav" file of 2,600,000 bytes the factor is
  about 35; for this case the estimate of extra memory needed is
  91,000,000.</p>

  <p>In order for the "Wyman1x-demod-decode" program to operate correctly,
  the sum of physical memory available to the program, after it is loaded,
  and the amount of swap space available must be greater than the amount of
  dynamically allocated memory needed by the program.</p>

  <p>If you want to operate on large "wav" files, you may need to increase
  the amount of swap space available.</p>

<a name="rxb"></a>
<h2>Receive Side: Recovery of Binary File</h2>
<p>The syntax normally used is:
<pre>

Wyman1x-demod-decode recorded-file.wav > recorded-file.txt

</pre>
  The "Wyman1x-demod-decode" program writes information gathered during the
  demodulation and decoding process to stdout.  Redirecting stdout to a file
  with the same root name as the recorded ".wav" file, to which it pertains,
  is an easy way to keep track of this information.</p>

<a name="cmb"></a>
<h2>Receive Side: Combining Multiple Code Blocks</h2>

  <p>Beginning with version 1.2.0, each completely corrected code block is
  written to a separate file.  A three digit number is appended to the name
  of the file being transferred in order to generate file names for these
  separate code block files.  If
  the file being transferred is named "file.xyz" then the name for the first
  code block is "file.xyz000", the name for the second code block is
  "file.xyz001, etc.</p>

  <p>If all code blocks are completely corrected, then all of the files
  containing just the data for the individual code blocks are deleted. 
  However, if at least one code block was not completely corrected, then all
  of the files containing completely corrected code blocks are left intact. 
  This facilitates combining completely corrected code blocks from multiple
  receptions into a single completely corrected file.</p>

  <p>After getting at least one completely corrected copy of each code block
  for a particular file (from an arbitrary number of receptions), the
  following command (to a bash shell), for the example of the file name being
  "file.xyz", will combine the individual code blocks into the completely
  corrected file.</p>
  <pre>
  cat file.xyz??? > file.xyz
  </pre>

  <p>Note that these multiple receptions could be from different receivers
  and a single transmission, as might be the case of the transmitter being
  located in a spacecraft and the signal being received at multiple
  locations.  These multiple receptions could also be from a single receiver
  and multiple transmissions, as might be the case for two operators working
  under difficult conditions.</p>

<h1>Authentication Information</h1>
<p>The file "md5sums.txt.asc" contains the md5sums for all but one of
 the files in this distribution.  The file excluded from the md5sums list is
 "md5sums.txt.asc".  This file is signed with my private pgp key.  The
 signature can be checked using my pgp public key, which is included in the
 file "doc/barry-pgp-key2.asc".</p>

  <p>To verify that you have an uncompromised copy of my public pgp key, you
  can send a request for verification to the U. S. postal address listed in
  the opening comment of the various source files.  I will then send the pgp
  "fingerprint" value (from executing "pgp -kvc") for my public pgp key back
  to your postal address.</p>

  <p>After adding my public pgp key to your public key ring, you can check
  the signature on the "md5sums.txt.asc" file with the command:  <pre>

  pgp md5sums.txt.asc

  </pre>executed from the directory containing the "md5sums.txt.asc" file.</p>

  <p>If the signature is verified, there will be a file named "md5sums.txt"
  created in the directory.  You can then check that the md5sums on the files
  you have match those listed in the file "md5sums.txt" with the following
  command:<pre>

  md5sum -c md5sums.txt

  </pre>executed from the directory which contains the "md5sums.txt" file.</p>
