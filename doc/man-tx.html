  <h1>Tx Side Manual Procedure</h1>
  <p>If you do not have tclsh installed, you can execute the three transmit
  side programs as described below.  The running example used below is for
  the case of an original file named "file.xyz" using 40% redundancy in the
  outer code, with the final result being the file named
  "file.xyz.W13.wav".</p>

  <h2>bin2sym307pm8a</h2> <p>The "bin2sym307pm8a" program requires two
  parameters.  First is the name of the file to be transfered. Second is a
  code for the amount of redundancy to be used in the outer level code.  The
  second parameter must be one of: 10, 20, 40, or 70.  The output is written
  to stdout.  It consists of a list of 32 bit unsigned integers.  Each
  integer represents one symbol.</p>

  <p>The command, for the running example, would be:
  <pre>

  bin2sym307pm8a file.xyz 40 > tmp1

  </pre>
  </p>

  <h2>mod-pm8a</h2>
  <p>The "mod-pm8a" program requires two parameters.  First is the name of
  the input file.  Second is the name of the output file.  The standard
  deviation of the sample values is written to stdout.  The output file
  consists of a sequence of 32 bit float values.</p>

  <p>The command, for the running example, would be:
  <pre>

  mod-pm8a tmp1 tmp2 > tmp3

  </pre>
  </p>

  <h2>clipping level and scale factor calculation</h2>
  <p>From the contents of the file "tmp3", get the value of the standard
  deviation of the sample values.  Call this value "sdsv".  For the case of
  the clipping level set to 2.17 standard deviations, calculate the value of
  the clipping parameter to supply to the "flt-clip-scale-wav" program by the
  following equation.</p>
  <pre>

  clip_level = 2.17 * sdsv

  </pre>
  <p>Calculate the value of the scale factor to supply to the
  "flt-clip-scale-wav" program by the following equation.
  <pre>

  scale_factor = 16383/clip_level

  </pre>
  </p>

  <h2>concatenate with ancillary data</h2>
  <p>To produce a file that contains the "2-tone" signal and the "chirp"
  signal before the phase modulated signal, execute the following command.
  <pre>

  cat 2tone1180-1520v4-3sec.flt chirp3b.flt tmp2 > tmp4

  </pre></p>

  <h2>flt-clip-scale-wav</h2>
  <p>The "flt-clip-scale-wav" program requires 4 parameters.
  <ol>
  <li>First is the input file name.
  <li>Second is the output file name.
  <li>Third is the clipping level.
  <li>Fourth is the scale factor.
  </ol>
  The clipping level and scale factor
  are the floating point numbers calculated above.</p>

  <p>The command, for the running example, would be:
  <pre>

  flt-clip-scale-wav tmp4 file.xyz.W13.wav clip_level scale_factor

  </pre>
  where the actual numbers are supplied for "clip_level" and "scale_factor".
  </p>

  <h2>remove temporary files</h2>
  <p>To remove all of the temporary files created by the above steps, execute
  the following command.
  <pre>

  rm tmp[1234]

  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>Note that deletion of the lo[0-7].flt and pm[0-7].flt temporary files is
  now done by the mod-pm8a program, and thus, does not need too be done
  manually.
