  <h1>Explanations of Some of the Above Parameters</h1>

  <a name="r53"></a>
  <h2>r53</h2
  <p>This number is a measure of the quality of fit between the actual
    leader data, and the "ideal" leader data.  The larger this number is, the
    better the fit.</p>

  <a name="cppb"></a>
  <h2>clock periods per block</h2>
      <p>This is the number of receiver clock periods per block, based on the
       slope of the least squares best fit straight line to the measured vs.
       ideal frequencies of the leader subcarriers.</p>
  
  <a name="Ris"></a>
  <h2>Results of initial search for framing sequences</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>subcarrier
    <p>This is an index identifying which subcarrier the data are for.</p>
  <li>offset
    <p>This is the number of sample periods, from the reference point, to
       the beginning of the first framing sequence.</p>
  <li>min product
    <p>This is the smallest product of mean_squared_errors and standard_deviation
     (of mean squared errors) for all of the framing sequences across all of
     the "offset" values tried.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>The smaller the "min product" the better.</p>

  <a name="Bmp"></a>
  <h2>Best min product found</h2>
  <p>After searching a range of "clock periods per block", around the previous
     estimate, this number is the best found.  It was found using the number
     listed as the "offset" as an offset to the previous estimate of the 
     number of clock periods per block.</p>
     <p>The next line of output states the updated value of the number of
  	clock periods per block, which will be the same as before, if the
  	offset is 0.</p>

  <a name="Rbf"></a>
  <h2>Results of best fit straight lines through better points</h2>
  <ul>
  <p>These numbers result from fitting a straight line, for each subcarrier,
     through the points corresponding to "1" in the "Better than average cases"
     table.</p>
  <li>subcarrier
    <p>This is an index identifying which subcarrier the data are for.</p>
  <li>offset
    <p>This is the number of sample periods, from the reference point, to
       the beginning of the first framing sequence.</p>
  <li>slope
    <p>This is the final estimate for the number of clock periods per block,
  	based on the data for the respective subcarrier.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>The final estimate for the number of clock periods per block is listed
     at the bottom of this table.</p>

  <a name="Ecm"></a>
  <h2>Error Correction Mode Determination Weights</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Mode Index
    <p>This number indicates which of the 4 possible levels of redundancy
  	in the outer code the "weight" is for.</p>
  <li>Weights
    <p>This is the sum of 1/(distance_from_closest) for each of the 12
  	mode id symbols.</p>
  </ul>
  <p>The mode with the largest weight is used in the decoding process.</p>
