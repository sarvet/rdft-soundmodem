  <p>Below are the major comments extracted, in order, from the
  "pm8a-demod-decode6q" program.  They provide an outline of the
  operations performed by this program.</p>
  <pre>

/* multiply by sin and cos of local oscillator */
/* do decimation */
/* do interpolation */
/* calculate angle, and remove discontinuities */
/* calculate Amplitude */
/* adjust angle of local oscillators */

/* calculate and store (in a separate buffer for each lo) the average difference

/* allocate buffers */
 /* end of lo==0 */

/* calculate starting point for search */
/* search for framing sequences */
   /* calculate product of mean and standard deviation,
	 leaving out largest value, if num_frsq > 2 */
 } /* end of for lo searching for framing sequences */

/* determine clock periods per block, from best framing sequence data*/
/* don't use data from subcarrier 0, due to non-linear phase filters in
	radios */
/* set index of best framing sequence */
/* use best (except for lowest freq) overall subcarrier for next step */
/* use best framing sequence for this subcarrier as the reference */
/* search for a better value for cppblk */
/* calculate product of mean and standard deviation,
	 leaving out largest value, if num_frsq > 2 */

/* refine framing sequence positions, based on actual data, for best subcarrier */
/* calculate least squares best fit straight line through the "better than
	 average" framing sequence positions */
/* if offset is different from 0, and this is the first pass,
   demodulate again */

/* calculate expected position for all framing sequences for all subcarriers,
	based on best framing sequence for best subcarrier */

/* take care of lowest frequency subcarrier as a special case */

	 average" framing sequence positions */

	calculated from the best fit straight lines */

/* adjust for tuning offset changes */

/* determine error correction mode (# of redundancy symbols per block) */
/* check three pair of symbols preceding 1st framing sequence */
/* check three pair of symbols following last framing sequence */

/* for each block 
	decode inner code from demodulated phase changes to channel symbol numbers
	decode array of channel symbol numbers
	output erasure and error correction information
	if 1st block
		extract filename, and file length, open file, store
		 remaining data in file
	else
		store all "non-dummy" data in file
*/
/* refine symbol positions, based on amplitude variation information:

   1. Fill sym_pos[][] with nominal symbol positions, based on surrounding
      framing sequence positions.  Fill ma1[][] with 0x00, to indicate
      nominal calculated positions.
   2. For all symbol locations with 0x00 in ma1[][], if local maximum of
      cross-correlation between amplitude reference pattern and actual
      amplitude values is greater than thld_amp1, and is within ossi_amp1
      index values of the nominal position, then use the location of this
      local maximum as the position of that symbol, and set the
      corresponding location in ma1[][] to 0x01.
   3. Extend, form both ends, each run of 0x01 values in ma1[][].  A run 
      is extended by adjacent local maximum cross-correlation values being
      > thld_amp2 and within ossi_amp2 locations of the, f_slope adjusted,
      position from the previous symbol's position.  Set the corresponding
      locations in ma1[][] to 0x02, for those symbols whose position was
      changed in this step.
   4. Replace symbol positions corresponding to remaining runs of 0x00 in
      ma1[][] with linearly interpolated values, based on the positions 
      corresponding to the non-0x00 entries in ma1[][] adjacent to the
      runs of 0x00.  Leave any end symbol positions with 0x00 values in
      ma1[][] as they are.  Set locations in ma1[][] corresponding to
      symbol positions changed in this step to 0x03.

/* merge raw blocks before decoding */
	/* save for diognostic output */
/* use hard erasures first, then soft erasures, until maximum number
	of allowed erasures are used up, or all hard and soft erasures
	are used up
	Soft erasures should really be sorted first, so that "most likely
	to be wrong" symbols are erased first */
	/* sort */
/* choose which merged blocks to use */
/* merge decoded blocks */
  if (j==0)	/* 1st block is special case */
/* extract header
	get file name, and file length
	open file, write data from first block
*/
/* process remaining blocks */
